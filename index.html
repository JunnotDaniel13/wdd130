      <p>
        Antananarivo, often referred to as "Tana," is the capital and largest
        city of Madagascar, located in the central highlands of the island. It
        serves as the political, economic, and cultural hub of the country,
        blending modern urban life with rich historical heritage. The city is
        known for its hilly terrain, colorful markets, and iconic Rova of
        Antananarivo, a royal palace complex that reflects its historical
        significance as the seat of the Merina monarchy. Despite its bustling
        atmosphere, Antananarivo faces challenges such as rapid urbanization and
        infrastructure development, but it remains a vibrant center of Malagasy
        culture and tradition.
